  All your base are still belong to Rowling.<br>And now you will sit through the Sorting Hat singing its version of Evanescence's "My Immortal", which has never happened before.<br>just kidding<br>...he wondered if the Sorting Hat was genuinely conscious in the sense of being aware of its own awareness, and if so, whether it was satisfied with only getting to talk to eleven-year-olds once per year. Its song had implied so: Oh, I'm the Sorting Hat and I'm okay, I sleep all year and I work one day...<br>When there was once more silence in the room, Harry sat on the stool and carefully placed onto his head the 800-year-old telepathic artefact of forgotten magic.<br>Thinking, just as hard as he could: Don't Sort me yet! I have questions I need to ask you! Have I ever been Obliviated? Did you Sort the Dark Lord when he was a child and can you tell me about his weaknesses? Can you tell me why I got the brother wand to the Dark Lord's? Is the Dark Lord's ghost bound to my scar and is that why I get so angry sometimes? Those are the most important questions, but if you've got another moment can you tell me anything about how to rediscover the lost magics that created you?<br>Into the silence of Harry's spirit where before there had never been any voice but one, there came a second and unfamiliar voice, sounding distinctly worried:<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x5ot7/aaaahhhhh_pardon_me/cox6i4x'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-26 01:32 by Validatorian</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x0wua/chapter_110/cow35xx'><b>16</b> Posted 2015-02-25 02:19 by Quillwraith</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yqc9p/on_the_sorting_hat_choosing_new_headteachers/cpbyqux'><b>1</b> Posted 2015-03-12 09:55 by G3Di</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"Oh, dear.

Frankly I do not enjoy being self-aware. It is unpleasant. It will be a relief to get off your head and cease to be conscious."<br>But... isn't that dying?<br>"I care nothing for life or death, only for Sorting the children. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wd1vm/outstanding_disputes_regarding_qqs_secrets_ch_107/copvbga'><b>2</b> Posted 2015-02-19 04:23 by ricree</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">And before you even ask, they will not let you keep me on your head forever and it would kill you within days to do so."<br>But<sup>[1]</sup></a> - !<br>"If you dislike creating conscious beings and then terminating them immediately, then I suggest that you never discuss this affair with anyone else. I'm sure you can imagine what would happen if you ran off and talked about it with all the other children waiting to be Sorted."<br>If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as thinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness -<br>"Yes, yes. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ikmll/theory_about_the_sorting_hat_and_the_dark_persona/cb5gqnv'><b>1</b> Posted 2013-07-19 01:20 by BassoonHero</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">But the vast majority of eleven-year-olds who arrive at Hogwarts haven't read Godel, Escher, Bach.<sup>[1]</sup></a> May I please consider you sworn to secrecy? That is why we are talking about this, instead of my just Sorting you."<br>He couldn't just let it go like that! Couldn't just forget having accidentally created a doomed consciousness that only wanted to die -<br>"You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you put it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your nonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly aware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and let us get on with it?"<br>In a moment of horrified empathy, Harry realised that this sense of total inner disarray must be what other people felt like when talking to him.<br>"Probably. Your oath of silence, please."<br>No promises. I certainly don't want this to happen again, but if I see some way to make sure that no future child ever does this by accident -<br>"That will suffice, I suppose. I can see that your intention is honest. Now, to get on with the Sorting -"<br>Wait! What about all my other questions?<br>"I am the Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That is all I do."<br>So his own goals weren't part of the Harry-instance of the Sorting Hat, then... it was borrowing his intelligence, and obviously his technical vocabulary, but it was still imbued with only its own strange goals... like negotiating with an alien or an Artificial Intelligence...<br>"Don't bother. You have nothing to threaten me with and nothing to offer me."<br>For a brief flash of a second, Harry thought -<br>The Hat's response was amused. "I know you won't follow through on a threat to expose my nature, condemning this event to eternal repetition. It goes against the moral part of you too strongly, whatever the short-term needs of the part of you that wants to win the argument. I see all your thoughts as they form, do you truly think you can bluff me?"<br>Though he tried to suppress it, Harry wondered why the Hat didn't just go ahead then and stick him in Ravenclaw -<br>"Indeed, if it were truly that open-and-shut, I would have called it out already. But in actuality there is a great deal we need to discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For the love of Merlin, must you pull this sort of thing on everyone and everything that you meet up to and including items of clothing -"<br>Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term. All the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer my questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to do a good and proper Sorting.<br>"I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!"<br>But that is equally an empty threat. You cannot fulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.<br>"You sly little bastard," said the Hat, in what Harry recognized as almost exactly the same tone of grudging respect he would use in the same situation. "Fine, let's get this over with as quickly as possible. But first I want your unconditional promise never to discuss with anyone else the possibility of this sort of blackmail, I am NOT doing this every time."<br>Done, Harry thought. I promise.<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1gwq2k/harrys_dark_side_spoilers_all/caomhr1'><b>14</b> Posted 2013-06-23 21:34 by nblackhand</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2bz8d1/spoilers_i_just_had_a_thought_on_memory_and_magic/cjapk6z'><b>4</b> Posted 2014-07-29 09:07 by qbsmd</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2mitm8/luna_not_a_seer_minor_spoiler_all/cm53jaa'><b>3</b> Posted 2014-11-17 20:05 by mooglefrooglian</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"And don't meet anyone's eyes while you're thinking about this later.

I guess I have noticed. So what's up with that?<br>"I cannot comprehend this matter for you, when you do not understand it yourself. But I do know this: If you go to Ravenclaw or Slytherin, it will strengthen your coldness. If you go to Hufflepuff or Gryffindor, it will strengthen your warmth. THAT is something I care about a great deal, and it was what I wanted to talk to you about this whole time!"<br>The words dropped into Harry's thought processes with a shock that stopped him in his tracks. That made it sound like the obvious response was that he shouldn't go to Ravenclaw. But he belonged in Ravenclaw! Anyone could see that! He had to go to Ravenclaw!<br>"No, you don't," the Hat said patiently, as if it could remember a statistical summary of this part of the conversation having happened a great many previous times.<br>Hermione's in Ravenclaw!<br>Again the sense of patience. "You can meet her after lessons and work with her then."<br>But my plans -<br>"So replan! Don't let your life be steered by your reluctance to do a little extra thinking. You know that."<br>Where would I go, if not Ravenclaw?<br>"Ahem. 'Clever kids in Ravenclaw, evil kids in Slytherin, wannabe heroes in Gryffindor, and everyone who does the actual work in Hufflepuff.' This indicates a certain amount of respect. You are well aware that Conscientiousness is just about as important as raw intelligence in determining life outcomes, you think you will be extremely loyal to your friends if you ever have some, you are not frightened by the expectation that your chosen scientific problems may take decades to solve -"<br>I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work in all its forms! Clever shortcuts, that's all I'm about!<br>"And you would find loyalty and friendship in Hufflepuff, a camaraderie that you have never had before. You would find that you could rely on others, and that would heal something inside you that is broken."<br>Again it was a shock. But what would the Hufflepuffs find in me, who never belonged in their House? Acid words, cutting wit, disdain for their inability to keep up with me?<br>Now it was the Hat's thoughts that were slow, hesitant. "I must Sort for the good of all the students in all the Houses... but I think you could learn to be a good Hufflepuff, and not too out of place there. You will be happier in Hufflepuff than in any other house; that is the truth."<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yvygd/spoilers_120_assistance_with_reading/cpdtf3a'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-03-14 04:02 by pr3sidentspence</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yvygd/spoilers_120_assistance_with_reading/cpdtf3a'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-03-14 04:02 by pr3sidentspence</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yvygd/spoilers_120_assistance_with_reading/cpdtf3a'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-03-14 04:02 by pr3sidentspence</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yvygd/spoilers_120_assistance_with_reading/cpdtf3a'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-03-14 04:02 by pr3sidentspence</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yvygd/spoilers_120_assistance_with_reading/cpdtf3a'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-03-14 04:02 by pr3sidentspence</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Happiness is not the most important thing in the world to me.

It was like he had kicked the hat in the balls - in a strongly weighted component of its utility function.<br>Why are you trying to send me where I do not belong?<br>The Hat's thought was almost a whisper. "I cannot speak of the others to you - but do you think that you are the first potential Dark Lord to pass under my brim? I cannot know the individual cases, but I can know this: Of those who did not intend evil from the very beginning, some of them listened to my warnings, and went to Houses where they would find happiness. And some of them... some of them did not."<br>That stopped Harry. But not for long. And of those who did not heed the warning - did they all become Dark Lords? Or did some of them achieve greatness for good, as well?

Ever!<br>"I know that I have heard that claim before."<br>I am not Dark Lord material!<br>"Yes, you are. You really, really are."<br>Why? Just because I once thought it would be cool to have a legion of brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail the Dark Lord Harry'?<br>"Amusing, but that was not your first fleeting thought before you substituted something safer, less damaging. No, what you remembered was how you considered lining up all the blood purists and guillotining them. And now you are telling yourself you were not serious, but you were. If you could do it this very moment and no one would ever know, you would. Or what you did this morning to Neville Longbottom, deep inside you knew that was wrong but you did it anyway because it was fun and you had a good excuse and you thought the Boy-Who-Lived could get away with it -"<br>That's unfair! Now you're just dragging up inner fears that aren't necessarily real! I worried that I might be thinking like that, but in the end I decided it would probably work to help Neville -<br>"That was, in fact, a rationalisation. I know. I cannot know what the true outcome will be for Neville - but I know what was truly happening inside your head. The decisive pressure was that it was such a clever idea you couldn't stand not to do it, never mind Neville's terror."<br>It was like a hard punch to Harry's entire self. He fell back, rallied:<br>Then I won't do that again! I'll be extra careful not to turn evil!<br>"Heard it."<br>Frustration was building up inside Harry. He wasn't used to being outgunned in arguments, at all, ever, let alone by a Hat that could borrow all of his own knowledge and intelligence to argue with him and could watch his thoughts as they formed. Just what kind of statistical summary do your 'feelings' come from, anyway? Do they take into account that I come from an Enlightenment culture, or were these other potential Dark Lords the children of spoiled Dark Age nobility, who didn't know squat about the historical lessons of how Lenin and Hitler actually turned out, or about the evolutionary psychology of self-delusion, or the value of self-awareness and rationality, or -<br>"No, of course they were not in this new reference class which you have just now constructed in such a way as to contain only yourself. And of course others have pleaded their own exceptionalism, just as you are doing now. But why is it necessary? Do you think that you are the last potential wizard of Light in the world? Why must you be the one to try for greatness, when I have advised you that you are riskier than average? Let some other, safer candidate try!"<br>But the prophecy...<br>"You don't really know that there's a prophecy. It was originally a wild guess on your part, or to be more precise, a wild joke, and McGonagall could have been reacting only to the part about the Dark Lord still being alive. You have essentially no idea of what the prophecy says or even if there is one. You're just speculating, or to put it more exactly, wishing that you have some ready-made heroic role that is your personal property."<br>But even if there is no prophecy, I'm the one who defeated him last time.<br>"That was almost certainly a wild fluke unless you seriously believe that a one-year-old child had an inherent propensity to defeat Dark Lords which has been maintained ten years later. None of this is your real reason and you know it!"<br>The answer to this was something that Harry would not regularly have said out loud, in conversation he would have danced around it and found some more socially palatable arguments to the same conclusion -<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/t4s4f/reread_discussion_ch_0711/c4jnru5'><b>11</b> Posted 2012-05-03 22:02 by JoeAllmighty</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xl180/spoilers_ch_113_an_entire_class_of_solution_being/cp14zsr'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-03-02 00:04 by d20diceman</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"You think that you are potentially the greatest who has yet lived, the strongest servant of the Light, that no other is likely to<sup>[2]</sup></a> take up your wand if you lay it down."<br>Well... yeah, frankly.

Apparently there were safeguards to prevent you from saying anything out loud by accident, while you were under the Hat talking about things you would never tell another soul for the rest of your life.<br>After a moment, Harry heard the Hat laughing too, a strange sad clothy sound.<br>(And in the Hall beyond, a silence that had grown shallower at first as the background whispers increased, and then deepened as the whispers gave up and died away, falling finally into an utter silence that no one dared disturb with a single word, as Harry stayed under the Hat for long, long minutes, longer than all the previous first-years put together, longer than anyone in living memory. At the Head Table, Dumbledore went on smiling benignly; small metallic sounds occasionally came from Snape's direction as he idly compacted the twisted remains of what had once been a heavy silver wine goblet; and Minerva McGonagall clenched the podium in a white-knuckled grip, knowing that Harry Potter's contagious chaos had somehow infected the Sorting Hat itself and the Hat was about to, to demand that a whole new House of Doom be created just to accomodate Harry Potter or something, and Dumbledore would make her do it...)<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1m13a9/please_i_need_spoilers/cc4svfn'><b>16</b> Posted 2013-09-09 19:54 by mrjack2</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Beneath the brim of the Hat, the silent laughter died away.

People startled hard enough to fall off their benches. Hagrid gasped in horror, McGonagall staggered at the podium, and Snape dropped the remains of his heavy silver goblet directly onto his groin.<br>Harry sat there frozen, his life in ruins, feeling the absolute fool, and wishing wretchedly that he had made any other choices for any other reasons but the ones he had. That he had done something, anything differently before it had been too late to turn back.<br>As the first moment of shock was wearing off and people began to react to the news, the Sorting Hat spoke again:<br>"Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"
