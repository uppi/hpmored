  The gibbous moon riding higher in the cloudless sky, the stars and wash of the Milky Way visible in all their majesty within the darkness: All these illuminated thirty-seven skull masks gleaming above black robes, and the darker-clad Lord Voldemort, whose eyes shone red. "Welcome, my Death Eaters," spoke Lord Voldemort's voice, smooth and high and terrible. "No, do not look at me, you fools! Eyes upon the Potter child! Ten years, it has been, ten years since we last met. Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday..." The Dark Lord Voldemort came near to one hooded figure, tapped fingers upon the mask. "In a hastily Transfigured mockery of a Death Eater's true armor, with a childish Charm to distort your voice. Explain, Mr. Honor." "Our old masks and robes..." said the robe whose mask the Dark Lord had tapped. Even through the distorting timbre of the mask, the fear in it was audible. "We... we were not fighting in them, Master, with you gone... so I did not maintain their enchantments... and then you summoned me to appear here, masked, and I... I always held faith in you, Master, but I did not know you would return this very day... I am truly sorry to have displeased you..." "Enough." The Dark Lord moved on to stand behind another figure, that seemed to tremble, though it kept its mask facing the Boy-Who-Lived, and its wand held level. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2ytpf8/chapter_120/cpdc5r4'><b>10</b> Posted 2015-03-13 14:47 by qbsmd</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"I might think more kindly of such neglect, if you had pursued my agenda by other means...

I find you playing ordinary politics in the Wizengamot!<sup>[1]</sup></a> I find your brothers still abandoned in Azkaban! It is a disappointment to me... I confess myself disappointed... You thought I was gone, the Dark Mark dead, and you forsook my purpose. Is that right, Mr. Counsel?" "No, Master!" cried that masked figure. "We knew you would return - but, but we could not fight Dumbledore without you -" "Crucio." A horrible scream tore out of the mask, piercing the night, it continued for long, long seconds. "Get up," the Dark Lord said to the figure that had collapsed upon the ground. "Keep your wand on Harry Potter. Do not lie to me again." "Yes, Master," sobbed the figure, as it pushed itself to its feet. Voldemort resumed pacing behind the black-robed figures. "I suppose you are also wondering what Harry Potter is doing here... Why he is a guest at my rebirthing party." "I know, Master!" said one of the robes. "You mean to prove your power by killing him, in front of us all, to leave no doubt as to which of you is stronger! To show how your Killing Curse can slay even this so-called Boy-Who-Lived!" There was a pause. None of the cloaked figures dared to speak. Slowly, the Dark Lord Voldemort, in his high-collared shirt and dark robes, turned to face the Death Eater who had spoken. "That," whispered Voldemort in a voice chill as death, "is a little too much folly for me to credit, Mr. Sallow. You heard that theory of how I died, and tried to provoke me into repeating a mistake?" Lord Voldemort was floating, rising high off the ground. "I suppose you came to prefer your laziness to my mastery, Macnair?â¯" The Death Eater who'd spoken was suddenly surrounded by a blue haze. He spun, slashed his wand at the Dark Lord, and cried "Avada Kedavra!â¯" Voldemort simply tilted to one side in midair, dodging the green bolt. "Avada Kedavra!â¯" cried the Death Eater. His hand that didn't hold a wand was making other gestures, further colors and layers building up in his shielding haze with each gesture completed. "Help me, my brothers!

I have less need of you than I once did, Mr. White. In two days' time the Death Eaters shall walk openly. My powers have increased, and I have just this day disposed of Dumbledore." More gasps of shock arose from the Death Eaters, Voldemort paid them no heed. "Tomorrow I shall slay Bones, Crouch, Moody, and Scrimgeour, if they have not fled. The rest of you shall go into the Ministry and the Wizengamot, and cast Imperius Curses as I direct you. We are finished waiting. By tomorrow's nightfall I shall have declared myself Lord Ruler of Britain!" Intakes of breath rose from the gathered masks, but one figure was laughing. "You find me amusing, Mr. Grim?" "Apologies, Master," said the robed figure who had laughed, his wand perfectly level upon where Harry stood. "I was glad to hear you had dispatched Dumbledore. I fled from Britain in cowardly fear of him, having lost faith in your return." Voldemort's chuckle resounded within the graveyard. "Your candor earns you my mercy, Mr. Grim. I was surprised to see you here tonight; you are more competent than I suspected. But before we turn our attention to happier matters, there is a certain affair to which we must attend. Tell me, Mr. Grim, if the Boy-Who-Lived swore an oath to you, might you trust him?" "Master... I don't understand..." said Mr. Grim. One or two of the other Death Eaters turned their masks toward Voldemort before quickly fixing the skull gaze on Harry. "Answer me," Voldemort hissed. "This is not a trick, Mr. Grim, and you will answer truthfully or bear the consequences. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xhp6p/spoilers_113_something_that_doesnt_help/cp075y8'><b>36</b> Posted 2015-02-28 23:44 by TheMoneyOfArt</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xhp6p/spoilers_113_something_that_doesnt_help/cp075y8'><b>36</b> Posted 2015-02-28 23:44 by TheMoneyOfArt</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xumf9/spoilers_to_115_lets_play_name_the_death_eaters/cp3jttz'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-03-04 03:55 by MoralRelativity</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">You knew the boy's forebears, did you not?

And for the bonder of the Unbreakable Vow... which of you shall sacrifice their magic? It shall be quite the long Vow... much longer than usual... much magic shall be required for that..." Voldemort smiled his awful smile. "Mr. White shall do." "No, please! Master, I beg you!

Mr. White took time to approach, the black robes seeming to shake, even as Mr. Grim moved smoothly into position. "What is to be the Vow, Master?" came the voice of Mr. Grim. "Ah, yes," Voldemort said. The Dark Lord went on pacing behind the semicircle of Death Eaters. "Today - though I hardly expect even you to believe me - today we are doing Merlin's work, my Death Eaters. Yes! Before us stands a great danger, who in his blundering folly has been prophesied to wreak destruction such as even I can scarcely imagine. The Boy-Who-Lived! The boy who frightens Dementors! The cattle who believe they own this world should have been more worried when they saw that. Useless, all of them!" "Forgive me -" said one black robe in a halting voice.

"I think, Master, that it must be repeated to me." Voldemort smiled that too-wide smile, and said it all again using different words.

If Harry raises his wand or speaks in anything except Parseltongue, the Death Eaters will fire on him immediately. 5. If the simplest timeline is otherwise one where Harry dies - if Harry cannot reach his Time-Turner without Time-Turned help - then the Time-Turner will not come into play. 6. It is impossible to tell lies in Parseltongue. Within these constraints, Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a rationalist, now in this moment or never, regardless of his previous flaws. Of course 'the rational solution', if you are using the word 'rational' correctly, is just a needlessly fancy way of saying 'the best solution' or 'the solution I like' or 'the solution I think we should use', and you should usually say one of the latter instead. (We only need the word 'rational' to talk about ways of thinking, considered apart from any particular solutions.) And by Vinge's Principle, if you know exactly what a smart mind would do, you must be at least that smart yourself. Asking someone "What would an optimal player think is the best move?" should produce answers no better than "What do you think is best?" So what I mean in practice, when I say Harry is allowed to attain his full potential as a rationalist, is that Harry is allowed to solve this problem the way YOU would solve <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xjc8n/spoilers_ch_113_the_defense_professors_utility/cp0lpug'><b>23</b> Posted 2015-03-01 08:40 by alexanderwales</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xjc8n/spoilers_ch_113_the_defense_professors_utility/cp0lpug'><b>23</b> Posted 2015-03-01 08:40 by alexanderwales</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xhqa1/spoilers_113_lets_take_5_minutes_to_think_about/cp07iix'><b>19</b> Posted 2015-02-28 23:56 by Swag_Bro_420</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xic42/spoilers_ch_113_problem_constraints/cp0ea2j'><b>12</b> Posted 2015-03-01 03:55 by EriktheRed</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xhqa1/spoilers_113_lets_take_5_minutes_to_think_about/cp0bcb1'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-03-01 02:09 by chirokidz</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xhrvt/solutions_thread/cp07cpr'><b>1</b> Posted 2015-02-28 23:50 by Swag_Bro_420</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">it. If you can tell me exactly how to do something, Harry is allowed to think of it. But it does not serve as a solution to say, for example, "Harry should persuade Voldemort to let him out of the box" if you can't<sup>[6]</sup></a> yourself figure out how. The rules on Fanfiction dot Net allow at most one review per chapter. Please submit *ONLY ONE* review of Ch. 113, to submit one suggested solution. For the best experience, if you have not already been following Internet conversations about recent chapters, I suggest not doing so, trying to complete this exam on your own, not looking at other reviews, and waiting for Ch. 114 to see how you did. I wish you all the best of luck, or rather the best of skill. Ch. 114 will post at 10AM Pacific (6PM UTC) on Tuesday, March 3rd, 2015. ADDED: If you have pending exams, then even though the bystander effect is a thing,I expect that the collective effect of 'everyone with more urgent life issues stays out of the effort' shifts the probabilities very little (because diminishing marginal returns on more eyes and an already-huge population that is participating). So if you can't take the time, then please don't. Like any author, I enjoy the delicious taste of my readers' suffering, finer than any chocolate; but I don't want to *hurt* you. Likewise, if you hate hate hate this sort of thing, then don't participate! Other people ARE enjoying it. Just come back in a few days. I shouldn't even need to point this out. I remind you again that you have hours to think. Use the Hold Off On Proposing Solutions, Luke. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xjvaq/so_whats_the_relationship_between_parseltongue/cp0qk9k'><b>2</b> Posted 2015-03-01 14:00 by Swag_Bro_420</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">And really truly, I do mean it, Harry cannot develop any new magical powers or transcend previously stated constraints on them in<sup>[1]</sup></a> the next sixty seconds.
