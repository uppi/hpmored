  Tom Riddle. The words seemed to echo inside Harry's head, sparking resonances that as quickly died away, broken patterns trying to complete themselves and failing. Tom Riddle is a Tom Riddle was the Riddle There were other priorities occupying Harry's attention. Professor Quirrell was pointing a gun at him. And for some reason Lord Voldemort hadn't fired it yet. Harry's voice came out in more of a croak. "What is it that you want from me?" <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/conn02m'><b>103</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:00 by mor_ph</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/conn02m'><b>103</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:00 by mor_ph</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"Your death," said Professor Quirrell,<sup>[2]</sup></a> <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/conn02m'><b>103</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:00 by mor_ph</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/conn02m'><b>103</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:00 by mor_ph</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"is clearly not what I am about to say,<sup>[2]</sup></a> since I have had plenty of time to kill you if I wished.

"Crystal," Harry whispered. His body was still shaking, running programs more suited to fleeing a tiger than casting delicate spells or thinking. But Harry could think of one thing the person pointing a gun at him obviously wanted him to do, a question that person was waiting for him to ask, and Harry did so. "Why are you calling me Tom?" Professor Quirrell regarded him steadily. "Why am I calling you Tom? Answer. Your intellect is not everything I hoped for, but it should suffice for this." Harry's mouth seemed to know the answer before his brain could manage to focus on the question. "Tom Riddle is your name. Our name. That's who Lord Voldemort is, or was, or - something." <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/connjnq'><b>33</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:17 by HPMORreader</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/connpgy'><b>18</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:22 by SmuckersMarionBerry</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x12o8/spoilers_110_voldemorts_understanding_of_the/cow4pmk'><b>7</b> Posted 2015-02-25 03:04 by ManyCookies</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w7x4l/the_great_prophecy_misinterpretation_spoilers_76/coolpfr'><b>6</b> Posted 2015-02-18 01:46 by Fzzr</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2yhajo/spoilers_115_when_is_a_sock_scarier_than_a_wand/cp9j0r3'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-03-10 08:09 by Swag_Bro_420</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wd1vm/outstanding_disputes_regarding_qqs_secrets_ch_107/coq1y3s'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-02-19 07:50 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wd1vm/outstanding_disputes_regarding_qqs_secrets_ch_107/cor11gt'><b>1</b> Posted 2015-02-20 04:55 by fancy-free</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Professor Quirrell nodded.

Why, Professor Quirrell, why, why did it have to turn out like this, I don't, I don't, I don't want this to be happening... "Very well," Professor Quirrell said. "I grant you permission to offer me something I want." The gun gestured invitingly. "That is a rare privilege, child. Lord Voldemort does not usually negotiate for what he wants." Some part of Harry's mind scrabbled frantically, looking for something, anything that might be of more value to Lord Voldemort or Professor Quirrell than child hostages or Severus's death. Another part of him, the part that had never stopped thinking, already knew his answer. "You already have an idea for what you want from me," Harry said, through the sickness and the bleeding wounds in his soul. "What is it?" "Your help in obtaining the Philosopher's Stone." Harry swallowed. He couldn't stop his eyes from going to the gun, then back up at Professor Quirrell's face. He was aware that the hero in a storybook was supposed to say 'No', but now that he was actually in a situation like this, saying 'No' didn't seem to make sense. "I am disappointed that you need to think about this," said Professor Quirrell. "It is straightforward that you should obey me for now, since I hold every advantage over you. I have taught you better than this; in this situation you should certainly pretend to lose. You can expect to gain nothing by resisting, except pain. You should have calculated that it was better to answer sooner, and not earn my distrust." Professor Quirrell's eyes studied him curiously. "Perhaps Dumbledore has filled your ears with nonsense about noble defiance? I find such morals amusing, since they are so easy to manipulate. I assure you that I can make defiance seem morally worse, and you would be well advised to submit before I demonstrate how." The gun stayed pointed at Harry; but with a wave of Professor Quirrell's other hand, Tracey Davis rose up into the air, spun lazily, her limbs stretched out spreadeagle - - then, even as new adrenaline hammered at Harry's heart, Tracey floated back down again. "Choose," said Professor Quirrell. "This begins to try my patience." <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/connhj1'><b>58</b> Posted 2015-02-17 04:15 by writingathing</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">I should have spoken just then, before he might've ripped off Tracey's legs, no, I shouldn't have, the Headmaster said I mustn't<sup>[1]</sup></a> show Lord Voldemort that I'll do things if he threatens my friends because that will just make him threaten more of them - only what he said before isn't a threat it's just the sort of thing Lord Voldemort does - Harry took a deep breath, several of them. Whatever part of him kept on running on full automatic was screaming at the remainder of his mind that it could not afford to stay in shock. Shocks were of finite duration, neurons kept firing regardless, the only reason Harry's mind would shut down while his brain kept running was if Harry's self-model believed his mind would shut down - "I don't mean to try your patience," Harry said. His voice was cracking. That was good. Sounding like he was still in shock meant that Lord Voldemort might give him more time. "But if Lord Voldemort had a reputation for keeping his bargains, I don't know about it." <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wv13j/concerning_parselmouth_and_telling_the_truth/coueeim'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-02-23 16:19 by oh_by_the_way</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w55xv/things_being_and_not_being_said_in_parseltongue/conwki6'><b>3</b> Posted 2015-02-17 09:20 by vorkir</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2whs8z/are_we_being_paranoid_enough_about_parsletongue/cor2182'><b>2</b> Posted 2015-02-20 05:25 by scruiser</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"An obvious concern," Professor Quirrell said.

Professor Quirrell had adopted his lecturing pose from Battle Magic, like someone putting on a well-worn mask, but the gun remained pointed in his hand.

"You said," Harry's voice was strange in his own ears, "that the Philosopher's Stone had different powers from what legend said. You said that to me in Parseltongue. Tell me what the Stone really does, before I agree to help you get it." If it was something along the lines of gaining total power over the universe, then nothing was worth an incrementally greater chance of Lord Voldemort getting the Stone. "Ah," said Professor Quirrell, and smiled. "You are thinking. That is better, and as a reward I shall offer you a further incentive for cooperation. Eternal life and youth, the creation of gold and silver. Suppose these are true benefits of holding the Stone. Tell me, boy. What is the Stone's power?" It might have been the adrenaline still in him, being actually useful for his brain for once. It might have been the power of being told that an answer existed, and that the evidence wasn't a lie. "It can make Transfigurations permanent." Then Harry stopped, as he heard what his own mouth had just said. "Correct," said Professor Quirrell. "Thus, whoever holds the Philosopher's Stone is able to perform human Transfiguration." Harry's torn mind was knocked about yet again, as he realized what further incentive would be offered him. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xjp1j/spoilers_ch_113_there_is_a_problem_with_the_most/cp0qwdq'><b>2</b> Posted 2015-03-01 14:31 by coherentsheaf</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"You stole Miss Granger's remains and Transfigured them into some innocuous-appearing target," said Professor Quirrell.

Ah, I see your eyes going to that ring upon your hand, but of course Miss Granger would not be the little jewel set into the ring, would it? That would be too obvious. No, I expect you Transfigured Granger's remains into the ring itself, letting the aura of the Transfigured jewel mask the magic in the Transfigured ring." "Yes," Harry said, forcing out the word. It was a lie, for once, and Harry's glance had been deliberate. Harry had expected someone to challenge him on the steel ring, he'd tried to provoke that challenge so he could prove to be innocent yet again, though nobody had taken him up on it - maybe Dumbledore had just sensed that the steel by itself wasn't magical. "Fine and good," said Professor Quirrell.

Unless you desperately needed their help to get the Philosopher's Stone out of the magic mirror. And there wasn't any time left to plan, only the thought that, if Professor Quirrell really was going this far to get his help - what Harry wanted was to demand Professor Quirrell promise not to kill anyone in the future in exchange for his help now, but Harry had a strong sense that Professor Quirrell would reply 'Don't be ridiculous' and there wasn't time for ordinary conversation Harry had to guess the highest safe request in advance - Professor Quirrell's eyes narrowed, his lips parted - "If I help you," Harry's mouth said, "I want your promise that you aren't planning to turn on me when this is over. I want you to not kill Professor Snape or anyone else in Hogwarts for at least a week. And I want answers, the truth about everything that's been going on this whole time, everything you know about my nature." The pale blue eyes regarded him dispassionately. I really think we could have thought of something better to ask for than that, said Harry's Slytherin side. But I suppose we were legitimately out of time, and whatever we need to do next, answers will help. Harry wasn't listening to that voice right now. Cold chills were still going down his spine from hearing the words that had just come out of his lips, addressed to the man with the gun. "That is your condition for helping me to obtain the Stone?" said Professor Quirrell. Harry nodded, unable to form words. "Agreed," hissed Professor Quirrell.

He would stay with Professor Quirrell, go with him to get the Stone, save the student hostages, and... and... and Harry didn't know, except that he'd go on thinking. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wafqo/spoilers_up_to_106_on_dumbledores_busyness/coprfy0'><b>1</b> Posted 2015-02-19 02:29 by Little_Kitty</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"You actually are sorry about that?"

After that, Professor Sprout picked up Harry's wand, and wrapped it in shimmering cloth; then she placed it on the floor, and again pointed her wand at Harry. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wb91r/boo_spoilers_106/copc8yt'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-02-18 19:49 by Phhhhuh</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wb91r/boo_spoilers_106/copc8yt'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-02-18 19:49 by Phhhhuh</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Only then did Professor Quirrell lower his gun, which seemed to disappear into his hand,<sup>[2]</sup></a> and pick up Harry's wrapped wand, tucking it into his robes. The True Cloak of Invisibility was removed from the sleeping form of Lesath Lestrange, and Professor Quirrell took the Cloak, as well as Harry's pouch and Time-Turner. Then Professor Quirrell cast a mass Obliviation followed by the mass version of the False Memory Charm, the one that just had the subject fill in the blanks using their own suggestibility, on all the students present. Afterwards Professor Sprout floated away the sleeping children, now wearing an expression that seemed annoyed and preoccupied, as if they'd been in some Herbology accident. Professor Quirrell then turned back to where the Potions Master lay sprawled, bent over and placed his wand on Professor Snape's forehead. "<a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w9bqn/chapter_106/coostmj'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-02-18 05:15 by Iconochasm</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Alienis nervus mobile lignum."<sup>[1]</sup></a> The Defense Professor stepped back, and began to move his left fingers in the air as though manipulating a puppet on strings. Professor Snape pushed himself up from the ground by smooth motions, and stood once more before the corridor door. "Alohomora," Professor Quirrell said, pointing his wand at the forbidden door. The Defense Professor looked rather amused. "Would you do the honors, boy?" Harry swallowed. He was once again having second thoughts, and third thoughts. It was strange how you could do something even while knowing it was the wrong thing, not the selfish thing but the wrong thing to do on some deeper level. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wb91r/boo_spoilers_106/copc8yt'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-02-18 19:49 by Phhhhuh</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2wb91r/boo_spoilers_106/copc8yt'><b>5</b> Posted 2015-02-18 19:49 by Phhhhuh</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">But the man behind him was holding the gun; it had once more appeared in his hand at Harry's hesitation.<sup>[2]</sup></a> Harry laid his hand on the door-knocker, and took several deep breaths, again composing his mind as best he could. Go through with it, don't get shot, don't let the hostages die, be there to optimize events, be there to watch for opportunities and stay capable of taking them. It wasn't a good choice, but all the other ones seemed worse. Harry pushed open the forbidden door, and stepped through. The next (short) chapter will post on February 17th, 2015 at 5pm Pacific Time.
