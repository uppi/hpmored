  The grimness on Albus Dumbledore's face lasted only an instant before giving way to bewilderment. "Quirinus? What -" And then there was a pause. "Well," said Albus Dumbledore. "I do feel stupid." "I should hope so," Professor Quirrell said easily; if he had been at all shocked himself at being caught, it did not show. A casual wave of his hand changed his robes back to a Professor's clothing. Dumbledore's grimness had returned and redoubled. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x0wua/chapter_110/covvr97'><b>117</b> Posted 2015-02-24 23:10 by scruiser</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x240q/dumbledore_planned_recent_events_spoilers_ch_110/cowdjlj'><b>17</b> Posted 2015-02-25 07:24 by 75thTrombone</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x5vpe/i_am_there_spoilers_112/coxbffw'><b>1</b> Posted 2015-02-26 04:00 by HPMOR_fan</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"There I am, searching so hard for Voldemort's shade, never noticing that the Defense Professor of Hogwarts is a sickly, half-dead<sup>[9]</sup></a> victim possessed by a spirit far more powerful than himself.

"For that, I accept responsibility, which is something you will never understand." "You arranged for Severus Snape to hear the Prophecy that he brought to me." "I allowed it to happen," said Albus Dumbledore. "And there I was, all excited at having finally gained my own foreknowledge." Professor Quirrell shook his head as though in sadness. "So the great hero Dumbledore sacrificed his unwitting pawns, Lily and James Potter, merely to banish me for a few years." Albus Dumbledore's eyes were like stones. "James and Lily would have gone willingly to the death, if they had known." "And the little baby?" Professor Quirrell said.
