  June 4th, 1992. Daphne Greengrass was in the Slytherin common room, writing a letter to her Lady Mother (who was surprisingly intransigent about power-sharing, despite not even being in Hogwarts to exercise control) when she saw Draco Malfoy stagger in through the portrait door carrying what must have been a dozen books, Vincent and Gregory behind him each carrying a dozen more. The Auror who'd accompanied Malfoy stuck his head in briefly, then withdrew to who-knew-where. Draco looked around, then seemed to be struck by a bright idea as he staggered toward her, Vincent and Gregory following after. "Can you help me read these?" said Draco, sounding slightly out of breath as he approached. "What." Lessons were over, only the exams were left now, and since when did Malfoys ask Greengrasses for help with their homework? "These," Draco Malfoy said importantly, "are all the library books Miss Granger borrowed between April 1st and April 16th. I thought I'd go through them in case there are any Clues there, only then I thought, maybe you should help because you knew Miss Granger better." Daphne stared at the books. "The General read all that in two weeks?â¯" A twinge of pain went through her heart, but she suppressed it. "Well, I don't know if Miss Granger finished them all," Draco said. He held up a cautioning finger. "In fact, we don't know if she read any of them, or if she really borrowed them, I mean, all we've observed is that the library ledger says she checked them out -" Daphne suppressed a groan. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Malfoy had been talking like this for weeks.<sup>[11]</sup></a> There were some people who clearly were not meant to be involved with mysterious murders because it did strange things to their minds. "Mr. Malfoy, I couldn't read all these if I spent my whole summer doing nothing else." "Then just skim through them, please?" Draco said. "Especially if there's, you know, mysterious words scribbled in her handwriting, or a bookmark left inside, or -" "I've seen those plays too, Mr. Malfoy." Daphne rolled her eyes. "Don't we have Aurors now for -" "We're doomed!â¯" shrieked Millicent Bulstrode, as she burst up from the lower chambers into the Slytherin common room. People paused to look at her.

Looking around, Harry saw that Professor Quirrell seemed to be looking in his rough direction, though the Defense Professor's head had nodded to one side. The other students were still writing. Some of them were silently crying, but they were still writing. Continuing to fight was also a lesson Professor Quirrell had taught. Interminably later, the official exam time was up. A seventh-year student went from desk to desk, collecting the exams in Professor Quirrell's place. The last exam parchment was collected, and Professor Quirrell sat up straight. "My young students," he said softly. The seventh-year student had her wand trained on the Defense Professor's mouth, so that they all heard his voice seeming to come from right beside them. "I know... that probably seemed very fearsome to some of you... it is a different kind of fear from facing the enemy's wand... you must conquer it separately. So I... shall tell you this now. It is the custom of Hogwarts... that grades are given in the second week of June. But for my case... they can make an exception, I think." The Defense Professor smiled his familiar dry smile, tinged now as though by a suppressed grimace. "I know you are worried... that you were not prepared for this exam... that my lessons have not covered this material... and I quite forgot to mention... that it was approaching... though you should have known... it would come in time. But I have just now magically checked... the answers you have given on that... terribly, terribly important final exam... though of course only the Ministry grade is official... and assigned your full-year grades taking the results into account... and magically written your full grades down on these parchments," Professor Quirrell tapped a stack of parchments on the side of his desk, "which will now be handed out... an incredible spell... is it not?" A few students on the Ravenclaw side were looking indignant, but for the most part the students just looked relieved, and some Slytherins were chuckling. Harry would have laughed too, if not for the pain of watching Professor Quirrell gasp out the words. The seventh-year student standing beside Professor Quirrell pointed her wand and spoke an incantation in magical pseudo-Latin. The parchments rose up and started to drift through the air, separating in mid-flow to drift toward each student. Harry waited until his parchment had arrived on his desk, and then unfolded it. The parchment said EE+, which stood for Exceeds Expectations. It was the second-highest grade letter, the highest being Outstanding. In another world, a distant vanished world, a little boy named Harry would have shouted with indignation about receiving only the second-highest grade. This Harry sat quietly and thought. Professor Quirrell was making some point, and it wasn't as though the exact grade letter mattered in any other way. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Was Professor Quirrell saying that Harry had done relatively well, but not lived up to his full potential?

He had seen the point immediately, and even if it was a wrong point, he knew Professor Quirrell would never, ever be talked out of making it. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co4675x'><b>55</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:32 by scruiser</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2u11wv/chapter_103/co45mzg'><b>25</b> Posted 2015-01-29 04:15 by eqek</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"All of you in this room... have received grades of at least Acceptable.

"You may think that a grade of Dreadful...<sup>[11]</sup></a> is not fair. That Miss Granger was faced with a test... for which her lessons... had not prepared her. That she was not told... that the exam was coming on that day." The Defense Professor drew in a shaking breath. "Such is realism," said Professor Quirrell. "The only important test... may come at any time... be better prepared for it... than she was. As for the rest of you... those who have received Exceeds Expectations or above... have received my letters of recommendation... to certain organizations beyond Britain's shores... where your training might be completed. They will contact you... when you are old enough... if you still appear worthy... and if you have not failed an important test. And remember... from this day... you must train yourselves... you cannot rely... on future Defense professors. Your first year of Battle Magic is over... you are dismissed." Professor Quirrell sat back with his eyes closed, seeming to ignore the excited babble that broke out around him. In time most of the students had departed, and one remained, staying a prescribed distance from the Defense Professor. The Defense Professor opened his eyes. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2vyn3f/predictions_things_youre_excited_to_see_get/com8suz'><b>4</b> Posted 2015-02-15 20:41 by caffeine-overclock</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Harry raised the parchment with its EE+, still silent. The Defense Professor smiled, and it went all the way to those tired eyes.<sup>[1]</sup></a> "It is the same grade... that I received in my own first year." "Th, th, th," Harry couldn't make the words thank you come out, they were stuck in his suddenly closed throat, the Defense Professor tilting his head and giving him an inquiring stare, so Harry just bowed jerkily and then left the room.
