  That which can be destroyed by the Rowling should be.<br>Harry stared up at the gray ceiling of the small room, from where he lay on the portable yet soft bed that had been placed there. He'd eaten quite a lot of Professor Quirrell's snacks - intricate confections of chocolate and other substances, dusted with sparkling sprinkles and jeweled with tiny sugar gems, looking highly expensive and proving, in fact, to be quite tasty. Harry hadn't felt the least bit guilty about it either, this he had earned.<br>He hadn't tried to sleep. Harry had a feeling that he wouldn't like what happened when he closed his eyes.<br>He hadn't tried to read. He wouldn't have been able to focus.<br>Funny how Harry's brain just seemed to keep on running and running, never shutting down no matter how tired it got. It got stupider but it refused to switch off.<br>But there was, there really and truly was a feeling of triumph.<br>Anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program, +1 point didn't begin to cover it. Harry wondered what the Sorting Hat would say now, if he could put it on his head.<br>No wonder Professor Quirrell had accused Harry of heading down the path of a Dark Lord. Harry had been too slow on the uptake, he should have seen the parallel right away -<br>Understand that the Dark Lord did not win that day. His goal was to learn martial arts, and yet he left without a single lesson.<br>Harry had entered the Potions class with the intent to learn Potions. He'd left without a single lesson.<br>And Professor Quirrell had heard, and understood with frightening precision, and reached out and yanked Harry off that path, the path that led to his becoming a copy of You-Know-Who.<br>There was a knock at the door. "Classes are over," said Professor Quirrell's quiet voice.<br>Harry approached the door and found himself suddenly nervous. Then the tension diminished as he heard Professor Quirrell's footsteps moving away from the door.<br>What on Earth is that about? Is it what's going to get him fired eventually?<br>Harry opened the door, and saw that Professor Quirrell was now waiting several bodylengths away.<br>Does Professor Quirrell feel it too?<br>They walked across the now-deserted stage to Professor Quirrell's desk, which Professor Quirrell leaned on; and Harry, as before, stopped short of the dais.<br>"So," Professor Quirrell said. There was a friendly sense about him somehow, even though his face still kept its usual seriousness. "What was it you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Potter?"<br>I have a mysterious dark side. But Harry couldn't just blurt it out like that.<br>"Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "am I off the path to becoming a Dark Lord, now?"<br>Professor Quirrell looked at Harry. "Mr. Potter," he said solemnly, with only a slight grin, "a word of advice. There is such a thing as a performance which is too perfect. Real people who have just been beaten and humiliated for fifteen minutes do not stand up and graciously forgive their enemies. It is the sort of thing you do when you're trying to convince everyone you're not Dark, not -"<br>"I can't believe this! You can't have every possible observation confirm your theory!â¯"<br>"And that was a trifle too much indignation."<br>"What on Earth do I have to do to convince you?â¯"<br>"To convince me that you harbor no ambitions of becoming a Dark Lord?" said Professor Quirrell, now looking outright amused. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1d1mcr/important_observations_re_quirrels_conversation/c9m87e4'><b>6</b> Posted 2013-04-25 10:56 by jaiwithani</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"I suppose you could just raise your right hand."<br>"What?" Harry said blankly. "But I can raise my right hand whether or not I -"<sup>[1]</sup></a> Harry stopped, feeling rather stupid.<br>"Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "You can just as easily do it either way. There is nothing you can do to convince me because I would know that was exactly what you were trying to do. And if we are to be even more precise, then while I suppose it is barely possible that perfectly good people exist even though I have never met one, it is nonetheless improbable that someone would be beaten for fifteen minutes and then stand up and feel a great surge of kindly forgiveness for his attackers. On the other hand it is less improbable that a young child would imagine this as the role to play in order to convince his teacher and classmates that he is not the next Dark Lord. The import of an act lies not in what that act resembles on the surface, Mr. Potter, but in the states of mind which make that act more or less probable."<br>Harry blinked. He'd just had the dichotomy between the representativeness heuristic and the Bayesian definition of evidence explained to him by a wizard.<br>"But then again," said Professor Quirrell, "anyone can want to impress their friends. That need not be Dark. So without it being any kind of admission, Mr. Potter, tell me honestly. What thought was in your mind at the moment when you forbade any vengeance? Was that thought a true impulse to forgiveness? Or was it an awareness of how your classmates would see the act?"<br>Sometimes we make our own phoenix song.<br>But Harry didn't say it out loud. It was clear that Professor Quirrell wouldn't believe him, and would probably respect him less for trying to utter such a transparent lie.<br>After a few moments of silence, Professor Quirrell smiled with satisfaction. "Believe it or not, Mr. Potter," said the professor, "you need not fear me for having discovered your secret. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2dpzub/quirrell_wasnt_lying_about_this_at_least_spoilers/cjsivkc'><b>18</b> Posted 2014-08-17 11:43 by thecommexokid</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">I am not going to tell you to give up on becoming the next Dark Lord. If I could turn back the hands of time and somehow remove that<sup>[1]</sup></a> ambition from the mind of my child self, the self of this present time would not benefit from the alteration. For as long as I thought that was my goal, it drove me to study and learn and refine myself and become stronger. We become what we are meant to be by following our desires wherever they lead. That is the insight of Salazar. Ask me to show you to the library section which holds those same books I read as a thirteen-year-old, and I will happily lead the way."<br>"For the love of crap," Harry said, and sat down on the hard marble floor, and then lay back on the floor, staring up at the distant arches of the ceiling. It was as close as he could come to collapsing in despair without hurting himself.<br>"Still too much indignation," observed Professor Quirrell. Harry wasn't looking but he could hear the suppressed laughter in the voice.<br>Then Harry realized.<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/10rmjf/did_i_miss_something_current_to_ch_85/c6g290e'><b>-5</b> Posted 2012-10-01 22:55 by iguessillregister</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"Actually, I think I know what's confusing you here," Harry said. "That was what I wanted to talk to you about, in fact. Professor<sup>[1]</sup></a> Quirrell, I think that what you're seeing is my mysterious dark side."<br>There was a pause.<br>"Your... dark side..."<br>Harry sat up. Professor Quirrell was regarding him with one of the strangest expressions Harry had seen on anyone's face, let alone anyone as dignified as Professor Quirrell.<br>"It happens when I get angry," Harry explained. "My blood runs cold, everything gets cold, everything seems perfectly clear... In retrospect it's been with me for a while - in my first year of Muggle school, someone tried to take away my ball during recess and I held it behind my back and kicked him in the solar plexus which I'd read was a weak point, and the other kids didn't bother me after that. And I bit a math teacher when she wouldn't accept my dominance. But it's only just recently that I've been under enough stress to notice that it's an actual, you know, mysterious dark side, and not just an anger management problem like the school psychologist said. And I don't have any super magical powers when it happens, that was one of the first things I checked."<br>Professor Quirrell rubbed his nose. "Let me think about this," he said.<br>Harry waited in silence for a full minute. He used that time to stand up, which was more difficult than he had expected.<br>"Well," Professor Quirrell said after a while. "I suppose there was something you could say that would convince me."<br>"I have already guessed that my dark side is really just another part of me and that the answer isn't to never become angry but to learn to stay in control by accepting it, I'm not dumb or anything and I've seen this story enough times to know where it's going, but it's hard and you seem like the person to help me."<br>"Well... yes... very perspicacious of you, Mr. Potter, I must say... that side of you is, as you seem to have already surmised, your intent to kill, which as you say is a part of you..."<br>"And needs to be trained," Harry said, completing the pattern.<br>"And needs to be trained, yes." That strange expression was still on Professor Quirrell's face. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2ximzx/spoilers_113_the_unused_clues_thread/cp0kpwc'><b>6</b> Posted 2015-03-01 08:00 by lucassloan</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"Mr. Potter, if you truly do not wish to be the next Dark Lord, then what was the ambition which the Sorting Hat tried to convince<sup>[1]</sup></a> you to abandon, the ambition for which you were Sorted into Slytherin?"<br>"I was Sorted into Ravenclaw!â¯"<br>"Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, now with a much more usual-looking dry smile, "I know you are accustomed to everyone around you being a fool, but please do not mistake me for one of them. The likelihood that the Sorting Hat would play its first prank in eight hundred years while it was upon your head is so small as to not be worth considering. I suppose it is barely possible that you snapped your fingers and invented some simple and clever way to defeat the anti-tampering spells upon the Hat, though I myself can think of no such method. But by far the most probable explanation is that Dumbledore decided he was not happy with the Hat's choice for the Boy-Who-Lived.

If you had a medical test that was only wrong one time in a thousand, sometimes it would still be wrong anyway.<br>"Can I ask you never to repeat what I'm about to say?" said Harry.<br>"Absolutely," said Professor Quirrell. "Consider me asked."<br>Harry wasn't a fool either. "Can I consider you to have said yes?"<br>"Very good, Mr. Potter. You may indeed so consider."<br>"Professor Quirrell -"<br>"I won't repeat what you're about to say," Professor Quirrell said, smiling.<br>They both laughed, then Harry turned serious again. "The Sorting Hat did seem to think I was going to end up as a Dark Lord unless I went to Hufflepuff," Harry said. "But I don't want to be one."<br>"Mr. Potter..." said Professor Quirrell. "Don't take this the wrong way. I promise you will not be graded on the answer. I only want to know your own, honest reply. Why not?"<br>Harry had that helpless feeling again. Thou shalt not become a Dark Lord was such an obvious theorem in his moral system that it was hard to describe the actual proof steps. "Um, people would get hurt?"<br>"Surely you've wanted to hurt people," said Professor Quirrell. "You wanted to hurt those bullies today. Being a Dark Lord means that people you want to hurt get hurt."<br>Harry floundered for words and then decided to simply go with the obvious.

His fingers rubbed the bridge of his nose. "I don't think that's quite what I was trying to say. Mr. Potter, in the end people all do what they want to do. Sometimes people give names like 'right' to things they want to do, but how could we possibly act on anything but our own desires?"<br>"Well, obviously," Harry said. "I couldn't act on moral considerations if they lacked the power to move me.

That impulse is not only in my parents. And that impulse is what would be betrayed."<br>"In any case, Mr. Potter, you have not answered my original question," said Professor Quirrell finally. "What is your ambition?"<br>"Oh," said Harry. "Um.." He organized his thoughts. "To understand everything important there is to know about the universe, apply that knowledge to become omnipotent, and use that power to rewrite reality because I have some objections to the way it works now."<br>There was a slight pause.<br>"Forgive me if this is a stupid question, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "but are you sure you did not just confess to wanting to be a Dark Lord?"<br>"That's only if you use your power for evil," explained Harry.

But Mr. Potter, while the scope of your ambition is worthy of Salazar himself, how exactly do you propose to go about it? Is step one to become a great fighting wizard, or Head Unspeakable, or Minister of Magic, or -"<br>"Step one is to become a scientist."<br>Professor Quirrell was looking at Harry as if he'd just turned into a cat.<br>"A scientist," Professor Quirrell said after a while.<br>Harry nodded.<br>"A scientist?â¯" repeated Professor Quirrell.<br>"Yes," Harry said. "I shall achieve my objectives through the power... of Science!â¯"<br>"A scientist!â¯" said Professor Quirrell. There was genuine indignation on his face, and his voice had grown stronger and sharper. "You could be the best of all my students! The greatest fighting wizard to come out of Hogwarts in five decades! I cannot picture you wasting your days in a white lab coat doing pointless things to rats!"<br>"Hey!" said Harry. "There's more to science than that! Not that there's anything wrong with experimenting on rats, of course.

"Not perfect, Mr. Potter, but good enough for your first day. Headmaster, did you stay long enough to hear about the fifty-one points for Ravenclaw, or did you storm out as soon as you heard the first part?"<br>A brief look of disconcertment crossed Dumbledore's face, followed by surprise. "Fifty-one points for Ravenclaw?"<br>Professor Quirrell nodded. "He wasn't expecting them, but it seemed appropriate. Tell Professor McGonagall that I think the story of what Mr. Potter went through to earn back the lost points will do just as well to make her point. No, Headmaster, Mr. Potter didn't tell me anything. It's easy to see which part of today's events are her work, just as I know that the final compromise was your own suggestion.

Then since you have deprived him of my free services, you will pay for Mr. Potter's tutoring by a licensed Occlumency instructor."<br>"Such services do not come cheaply," Dumbledore said, looking at Professor Quirrell in some surprise. "Although I do have certain connections -"<br>Professor Quirrell shook his head firmly. "No. Mr. Potter will ask his account manager at Gringotts to recommend a neutral instructor. With respect, Headmaster Dumbledore, after the events of this morning I must protest you or your friends having access to Mr. Potter's mind. I must also insist that the instructor have taken an Unbreakable Vow to reveal nothing, and that <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/uh73q/reread_discussion_ch_1922/c4vn9fo'><b>2</b> Posted 2012-06-03 15:06 by bbrazil</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/uh73q/reread_discussion_ch_1922/c4vn9fo'><b>2</b> Posted 2012-06-03 15:06 by bbrazil</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">he agree to be Obliviated of each session immediately<sup>[2]</sup></a> afterward."<br>Dumbledore was frowning. "Such services are extremely expensive, as you well know, and I cannot help but wonder why you deem them necessary."<br>"If it's money that's the problem," Harry spoke up, "I have some ideas for making large amounts of money quickly -"<br>"Thank you Quirinus, your wisdom is now quite evident and I am sorry for disputing it. Your concern for Harry Potter does you credit, as well."<br>"You're welcome," said Professor Quirrell. "I hope you will not object if I go on making him a particular focus of my attentions." Professor Quirrell's face was now very serious, and very still.<br>Dumbledore looked at Harry.<br>"It is my own wish also," Harry said.<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2ykzfb/chapter_119/cpatjog'><b>33</b> Posted 2015-03-11 10:10 by qbsmd</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2ykzfb/chapter_119/cpapdh1'><b>30</b> Posted 2015-03-11 08:19 by Swag_Bro_420</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hi7h2/spoilers_through_ch90_puzzling_questions/caup5c9'><b>7</b> Posted 2013-07-03 01:00 by BassoonHero</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"So that's how it is to be..." the old wizard said slowly.

"Harry... you must realize that if you choose this man as your teacher and your friend, your first mentor, then one way or another<sup>[3]</sup></a> you will lose him, and the manner in which you lose him may or may not allow you to ever get him back."<br>That hadn't occurred to Harry. But there was that jinx on the Defense position... one which had apparently worked with perfect regularity for decades...<br>"Probably," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "but he will have the full use of me while I last."<br>Dumbledore sighed. "I suppose it is economical, at least, since as the Defense Professor you're already doomed in some unknown fashion."<br>Harry had to work hard to suppress his expression as he realized what Dumbledore had actually been implying.<br>"I will inform Madam Pince that Mr. Potter is allowed to obtain books on Occlumency," said Dumbledore.<br>"There is preliminary training which you must do on your own," said <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1v6854/why_slytherins_monster_may_not_be_dead/cep48by'><b>33</b> Posted 2014-01-14 10:31 by AnarchistMiracle</a><br><a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/25tei5/lies_and_halfturths_spoilers_to_101/chl9gqg'><b>7</b> Posted 2014-05-19 02:28 by erwgv3g34</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Professor Quirrell to Harry.

Harry said the moment Dumbledore was gone.<br>"Not today," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "and not tomorrow either, I'm afraid. It takes a lot out of me to cast, though less to keep going, and so I usually prefer to maintain it as long as possible. This time I cast it on impulse.

He was grinning. "So I am going to violate rule two - which was simply 'don't brag' - and tell you about something I have done.

"You didn't add any extra information to the plaque, did you?"<br>"Extra information?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding as if the idea had never occurred to him before and he was quite intrigued.<br>Which made Harry rather suspicious, considering that it'd taken less than a minute for Harry to think of it.<br>"Maybe you included a holographic message like in Star Wars?â¯" said Harry.

Students should not be heard talking about such things."<br>And the amazing thing about the way Professor Quirrell said it was how perfectly it maintained plausible deniability. It had been said in exactly the appropriate tone for someone who wasn't willing to discuss such things and thought students should steer away from them. Harry honestly didn't know whether Professor Quirrell was just waiting to talk about it until after Harry had learned to protect his mind.<br>"Got it," Harry said. "I won't talk with anyone else about that idea."<br>"Please be discreet about the whole matter, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said.

"But I think that's quite enough for today, Mr. Potter, I confess I am feeling a bit tired -"<br>"I understand. And thank you. For everything."<br>Professor Quirrell nodded, but he was leaning harder on his desk.<br>Harry quickly took his leave.
