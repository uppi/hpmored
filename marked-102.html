  June 3rd, 1992.<br>Professor Quirrell was very sick.<br>He'd seemed better for a while, after drinking his unicorn's blood in May, but the air of intense power which had surrounded him afterward hadn't lasted even a day. By the Ides of May, Professor Quirrell's hands had been trembling again, though subtly. The Defense Professor's medical regimen had been interrupted too early, it seemed.<br>Six days ago Professor Quirrell had collapsed at dinnertime.<br>Madam Pomfrey had tried to forbid Professor Quirrell from teaching classes, and Professor Quirrell had shouted at her in front of everyone. The Defense Professor had shouted that he was dying regardless, and would use his remaining time as he chose.<br>So Madam Pomfrey, blinking hard, had forbidden the Defense Professor from doing anything except teaching his classes. She'd asked for a volunteer to help her take Professor Quirrell to a room in the Hogwarts infirmary. More than a hundred students had risen to their feet, only half wearing green.<br>The Defense Professor no longer sat at the Head Table during mealtimes. He didn't cast spells during lessons. The oldest students who had the most Quirrell points helped him to teach, the seventh-years who had already sat their Defense N.E.W.T.s in May. They took turns floating him from his room in the infirmary to his classes, and brought him food at mealtimes. Professor Quirrell proctored his Battle Magic classes from a chair, sitting.<br>Watching Hermione die had hurt more than this, but that had ended much more quickly.<br>This is the true Enemy.<br>Harry had already thought that, after Hermione had died. Being forced to watch Professor Quirrell die, day by day, week by week, had not done much to change his mind.<br>This is the true Enemy I have to face, Harry thought in Wednesday's Defense class, watching Professor Quirrell leaning far to one side of his chair before that day's seventh-year assistant caught him. Everything else is just shadows and distraction.<br>Harry had been turning over Trelawney's prophecy in his mind, wondering if maybe the true Dark Lord had nothing to do with Lord Voldemort at all.

After this will come Professor McGonagall, Mum and Dad, even Neville in his time, unless the wound in the world can be healed before then.<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2bwxiz/what_would_happen_if_harry_takes_to_a_muggle/cjap4fu'><b>3</b> Posted 2014-07-29 08:50 by qbsmd</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">There was nothing Harry could do.

"Come in," said that voice.<br>Harry slipped inside and closed the door behind him, and cast the Quieting Charm. He stood as far away from Professor Quirrell as he could, just in case his own magic was making the Professor feel uncomfortable.<br><a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a target='_blank' href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2bqwqf/hpmor_chapter_102_july_25_2014/cj82dig'><b>58</b> Posted 2014-07-26 08:17 by EriktheRed</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Though the sense of doom was fading, fading with each passing day.<br>Professor<sup>[1]</sup></a> Quirrell was lying back in his infirmary bed, only his head propped up by a pillow.

Not the Defense Professor's own magic, then, but a device of some kind.<br>The book was Thinking Physics by Epstein, the same book Harry had lent to Draco a few months back.

The same books had said nothing about unicorns being smart.

Harry had gone over, and the sapphire eyes had stared at him inquisitively. Harry had tapped out the sequence 1-2-3 on the ground several times with his shoes. The unicorn had shown no sign of responding in kind. Harry had reached over, taken her hoof in his hand, and tapped the same sequence with the unicorn's hoof. The unicorn had only looked at him curiously.<br>And something about feeding the unicorn the sleeping-potion-laced sugar cubes had still felt like murder.<br>That magic gives their existence a weight of meaning which no mere animal could possess... to slay something innocent to save oneself, that is a very grave sin. Those two phrases, from Professor McGonagall, from the centaur, had both run through Harry's mind, over and over as the white unicorn had yawned, laid down on the ground, and closed its eyes for what would be the last time. The Transfiguration had lasted an hour, and Harry's eyes had watered repeatedly as he worked. The unicorn's death might not have come then, but it would come soon enough, and it was foreign to Harry's nature to try to refuse responsibility of any kind.

"I dislike to sound cliched... Mr. Potter... but the truth is... the Arts called Dark... really are not good for a person... in the end."<br>Professor Quirrell breathed in, breathed out. There was quiet for a time in the infirmary, the two of them watched only by the elaborately ornamented stone of the walls.<br>"Is there anything left... unsaid between us?" said Professor Quirrell. "I am not dying today... mind you... not right now... but I do not know how long... I shall be able to converse."<br>"There's," Harry said, swallowed again. "There's a lot of things, way too many things, but... it might be the wrong thing to ask, but I don't want - this one question unanswered - snake?"<br>A snake lay on the bed.<br>"I learned how the Killing Cursse workss.
