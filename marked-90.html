  A simple Innervate from the Headmaster had awakened Fred Weasley, followed by a preliminary healing Charm for a broken arm and cracked ribs. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hgwki/spoiler_discussion_thread_for_chapter_90/cau8ee9'><b>16</b> Posted 2013-07-02 08:01 by Iconochasm</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1iswuy/smuggling_spoilers_to_95/cb8kayx'><b>4</b> Posted 2013-07-23 20:28 by [deleted]</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Harry's voice had distantly told the Headmaster about the Transfigured acid inside the troll's head (Dumbledore had looked down over the side of the terrace and made a gesture before returning)<sup>[2]</sup></a> and then about the Weasley twins' minds having been tampered with, carrying on a separate conversation that Harry remembered but could not process. Harry still stood over Hermione's body, he hadn't moved from that spot, thinking as fast as he could through the sense of dissociation and fragmented time, was there anything he should be doing now, any opportunities that were passing irrevocably. Some way to reduce the amount of magical omnipotence that would be required later. A temporal beacon effect to mark this instant for later time travel, if he someday found a way to travel back further than six hours. There were theories of time travel under General Relativity (which had seemed much less plausible before Harry had run across Time-Turners) and those theories said you couldn't go back to before the time machine was built - a relativistic time machine maintained a continuous pathway through time, it didn't teleport anything. But Harry didn't see anything helpful he could do using spells in his lexicon, Dumbledore wasn't being very cooperative, and in any case this was several minutes after the critical location within Time <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hgwki/spoiler_discussion_thread_for_chapter_90/caua9ew'><b>9</b> Posted 2013-07-02 09:29 by rumblestiltsken</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hul36/it_ought_to_be_unforgivable_spoilers_94_possible/caza0g7'><b>2</b> Posted 2013-07-10 03:46 by Empiricist_or_not</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ill08/the_beginning_of_chapter_89_spoilers_89/cb6okx8'><b>1</b> Posted 2013-07-20 21:33 by nblackhand</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"Harry," the Headmaster whispered, laying his hand on Harry's shoulder. He had vanished from where he was standing over the Weasley<sup>[3]</sup></a> twins and come into existence beside Harry; George Weasley had discontinously teleported from where he was sitting to be kneeling next to his brother's side, and Fred was now lying straight with his eyes open and wincing as he breathed. "Harry, you must go from this place." "Hold on," said Harry's voice. "I'm trying to think if there's anything else I can do." The old wizard's voice sounded helpless. "Harry - I know you do not believe in souls - but whether Hermione is watching you now, or no, I do not think she would wish for you to be like this." ...no, it was obvious. Harry leveled his wand at Hermione's body - "Harry! What are you -" - and poured everything down his arm into his hand - "Frigideiro!" "- doing?" "Hypothermia," Harry said distantly, as he staggered. It'd been one of the spells he and Hermione had experimented on, a lifetime ago, so he was able to control it precisely, though it had taken a lot of power to affect that much mass. Hermione's body should now be at almost exactly five degrees Celsius. "People have been revived from cold water after more than thirty minutes without breathing. The cold protects you from brain damage, you see, it slows everything down. There's a saying Muggle doctors have, you're not dead until you're warm and dead - I think they even cool down the patient during some surgeries, if they have to stop someone's heart for a while." Fred and George started sobbing. Dumbledore's face was already streaked with tears. "I'm sorry," he whispered. "Harry, I'm so sorry, but you have to stop this." The Headmaster took Harry by the shoulders and pulled on him. Harry allowed himself to be turned away from Hermione's body, walked forward as the Headmaster pushed him away from the blood. The Cooling Charm would buy him time. Hours at least, maybe days if he could manage to keep casting the spell on Hermione or if they stored her body somewhere cold. Now there was time to think. Minerva had seen Albus's face and she'd known something was wrong; there had been time for her to wonder what had happened, and even who had died; her mind flashing to Alastor, to Augusta, to Arthur and Molly, all the most likely targets at the start of Voldemort's second rise. She had thought that she had steeled herself, she had thought herself ready for the worst. Then Albus spoke, and all the steel left her. Not Hermione - no - Albus gave her a brief space to weep; and then told her that Harry Potter, who had watched Miss Granger die, had seated himself outside the infirmary storeroom where Miss Granger's remains were being kept, refusing to move from the spot, and telling anyone who spoke to him to go away so he could think. The only thing that had elicited any reaction from the boy was when Fawkes had tried to sing to him; Harry Potter had shrieked at the phoenix not to do that, his feelings were real, he didn't want magic trying to heal them like they were a disease. After that Fawkes had refused to sing again. Albus thought that she might have the best chance of reaching Harry Potter now. So she had to pull herself together, and clean up her face; there would be time later for private grief, when her surviving children no longer needed her. Minerva McGonagall pulled together the dislocated pieces of herself, wiped her eyes a final time, and laid her hand on the doorknob of the infirmary section whose back storeroom was now being used, for the second time this century and for the fifth time since the castle of Hogwarts had been raised, as the resting place of a promising young student. She opened the door. Harry Potter's eyes gazed at her. The boy was sitting on the floor in front of the door to the back storeroom, and holding his wand in his lap. If those eyes were grieving, if they were empty, if they were even broken, it couldn't be seen from looking at the boy's face. There were no dried tears on those cheeks. "Why are you here, Professor McGonagall?" Harry Potter said. "I told the Headmaster I'd like to be left alone for a while." She couldn't think of anything to say. To help you - you're not all right - but she didn't know what to say, there was nothing she could imagine saying that would make things better. She hadn't planned ahead before she'd walked into the room, having not been at her best. "What are you thinking about?" Minerva said. It was the only sentence that came into her mind. Albus had told her that Harry had been saying, over and over, that he was thinking; and she had to get Harry talking, somehow. Harry stared half at her and half past her, a tension coming into his face, as she held her breath. It took a while before Harry spoke. "I'm trying to think if there's anything I should be doing right now," said Harry Potter. "It's hard, though. My mind keeps on imagining ways the past could have gone differently if I'd thought faster, and I can't rule out that there might be a key insight in there somewhere." "Mr. Potter -" she said falteringly. "Harry, I don't think it's healthy for you to be - thinking like that -" "I disagree. It's not thinking that gets people killed." The words were spoken in a level monotone, as though reciting lines from a book. "Harry," she said, hardly even thinking as she said it, "there's nothing you could have done -" Something flickered in Harry's expression. His eyes seemed to focus on her for the first time. "Nothing I could have done?â¯" Harry's voice rose on the last word. "Nothing I could have DONE? I've lost track of how many different ways I could've saved her! If I'd asked to have us all given communications mirrors! If I'd insisted on Hermione being taken out of Hogwarts and put in a school that isn't insane! If I'd snuck out immediately instead of trying to argue with normal people! If I'd remembered the Patronus earlier! If I'd thought through possible emergencies and trained myself to think about Patronuses earlier! Even at the very last minute it might not have been too late! I killed the troll and turned to her and she was still ALIVE and I just knelt next to her listening to her last words like an IDIOT instead of casting the Patronus again and calling Dumbledore to send Fawkes! <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hlwan/spoiler_discussion_thread_chapter_9192/cavmzqg'><b>23</b> Posted 2013-07-04 08:55 by NYKevin</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hw8ak/newcombs_problem_time_turners_and_choosing_to_fail/cayj2wz'><b>18</b> Posted 2013-07-09 03:49 by apoteo</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1km5i0/what_was_harry_thinking_spoilers_through_91/cbqf6v7'><b>8</b> Posted 2013-08-19 01:45 by pedanterrific</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Or if I'd just approached the whole problem from a different angle - if I'd looked for a student with a Time-Turner to send a message back<sup>[3]</sup></a> in time before I found out about anything happening to her, instead of ending up with an outcome that can't be altered - I asked the Headmaster to go back <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2bu1dl/dumbledores_paradox_spoilers_102/cj94fmd'><b>8</b> Posted 2014-07-27 19:01 by robryk</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">and save Hermione and then fake everything,<sup>[1]</sup></a> fake the dead body, edit everyone's memories, <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hoqwr/spoilers_through_92voldemort_evil/cawmhyb'><b>1</b> Posted 2013-07-06 02:13 by knome</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">but Dumbledore said that he tried something like that once and it didn't work and he lost another friend instead.<sup>[1]</sup></a> Or if I'd - if I'd only gone with - if, that night -" Harry pressed his hands over his face, and when he removed them again, his face was calm and composed once more. "Anyway," said Harry Potter, now in a monotone again, "I don't want to repeat that mistake, so I'm going to spend until dinnertime thinking if there's anything I should be doing. If I haven't thought of anything by then I'll go to dinner and eat.

Harry's voice was patient, like he was explaining things to a child who was certain<sup>[1]</sup></a> not to understand. He wasn't looking at her anymore, just staring off at the wall to her right side. "When you do a fault analysis, there's no point in assigning fault to a part of the system you can't change afterward, it's like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn't going to change next time. There's no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren't going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you're the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there. That's why Dumbledore has his room full of broken wands. He understands that part, at least." Some distant part of her mind made a note to wait until much later and then speak sharply to the Headmaster about what he was showing to impressionable young children. She might even scream at him this time. She'd been thinking about screaming at him anyway, because of Miss Granger - "You're not responsible," she said, though her voice trembled. "It's the Professors - it's us who are responsible for student safety, not you." Harry's eyes flicked back to her. "You're responsible?" There was a tightness in the voice. "You want me to hold you responsible, Professor McGonagall?" She raised her chin and nodded. It would be better, by far, than Harry blaming himself. The boy pushed himself up from where he was sitting on the floor, and took a step forward. "All right, then," Harry said in a monotone. "I tried to do the sensible thing, when I saw Hermione was missing and that none of the Professors knew. I asked for a seventh-year student to go with me on a broomstick and protect me while we looked for Hermione. I asked for help. I begged for help. And nobody helped me. Because you gave everyone an absolute order to stay in one place or they'd be expelled, no excuses. No matter what else Dumbledore gets wrong, he at least thinks of his students as people, not animals that have to be herded into a pen and kept from wandering out. You knew you weren't any good at military thinking, your first idea was to have us walking through the hallways, you knew some students there were better than you at strategy and tactics, and you still nailed us down in one room without any discretionary judgment. So when something you didn't foresee happened and it would've made perfect sense to send out a seventh-year student on a fast broom to look for Hermione Granger, the students knew you wouldn't understand or forgive. They weren't afraid of the troll, they were afraid of you. The discipline, the conformity, the cowardice that you instilled in them delayed me just long enough for Hermione to die. Not that I should've tried asking for help from normal people, of course, and I will change and be less stupid next time. But if I were dumb enough to allocate responsibility to someone who isn't me, that's what I'd say." Tears were streaming down her cheeks. "That's what I'd tell you if I thought you could be responsible for anything. But normal people don't choose on the basis of consequences, they just play roles. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hiay8/i_need_some_fresh_tinfoil_for_my_hat_spoilers_8890/cauxrrt'><b>7</b> Posted 2013-07-03 07:57 by saitselkis</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">There's a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense.<sup>[1]</sup></a> A stern disciplinarian would order the students back to their rooms, even if there was a troll roaming the hallways.

People like you aren't responsible for anything, people like me are, and when we fail there's no one else to blame." The boy strode forward to stand directly before her.

The boy's voice cracked again. "I have to think." She closed the door behind her, an awful and still mostly-muffled sound escaping her throat - Albus shimmered into existence beside her, taking on a brief garish hue as the Disillusionment wore off. She did not jump, quite. "I've told you, stop doing that," Minerva said. Her voice sounded dull in her own ears. "That was private." Albus flickered his fingers at the door behind her. "I was afraid Mr. Potter might do you some harm." The Headmaster paused, then said quietly, "I am very surprised that you stood there and took that." "All I had to do was say 'Mr. Potter', and he would have stopped." Her voice had dropped almost to a whisper. "Just that, and he would have stopped. And then he would have had no one to say those awful things to, no one at all." "I thought Mr. Potter's remarks were entirely unfair and undeserved," <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hgwki/spoiler_discussion_thread_for_chapter_90/cau8jfi'><b>19</b> Posted 2013-07-02 08:07 by [deleted]</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Albus said. "If it had been you, Albus, you would not have threatened to expel anyone leaving the room. Can you<sup>[1]</sup></a> honestly tell me otherwise?" Albus's brows rose. "Your role in this disaster was tiny, your decisions quite sensible at the time, and it is only Harry Potter's perfect hindsight that lets him imagine otherwise. Surely you are wiser than to blame yourself for this, Minerva." She knew perfectly well that Albus would be placing a picture of Hermione in that awful room of his, that it would occupy a place of honor. Albus would hold himself responsible, she was certain, even though he hadn't even been in Hogwarts at the time. But not her. So you also don't think it's worth the trouble of holding me responsible... She slumped against the nearest wall, trying not to let the tears emerge again; she'd never seen Albus weep save thrice. "You have always believed in your students, as I never have. They would not have been afraid of you. They would have known you would understand." "Minerva -" "I am not fit to succeed you as Headmistress. We both know it." "You are wrong," Albus said quietly. "When the time comes, you will be the forty-fifth Headmistress of Hogwarts and you will do an excellent job of it." She shook her head. "What now, Albus? If he will not listen to me, then who?" It was perhaps half an hour later. The boy still guarded the door to where his best friend's body lay, sitting his vigil. He was staring downward, at his wand as it lay in his hands. Sometimes his face screwed up in thought, at other times it relaxed. Although the door did not open, and there was no sound, the boy looked up. He composed his face. His voice, when he spoke, was dull.

There was a time of silence. The Defense Professor's gaze rested on the boy, the boy stared off seemingly at nothing. "There's some magics I mean to learn. Spells I could've used earlier today, if I'd thought to study them beforehand." The boy's voice was cold. "Spells I'll need, if this sort of thing goes on happening. Most I expect I can just look up. Some I expect I can't." The Defense Professor inclined his head. "I shall teach you almost any magic you wish to know, Mr. Potter. I do have some limits, but you may always ask. But what specifically do you seek? You lack the raw power for the Killing Curse and most other spells deemed forbidden -" <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x1cwi/ritual_chants_107/cow7unl'><b>6</b> Posted 2015-02-25 04:37 by Quillwraith</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2lql3a/exceptions_to_the_interdict_of_merlin/cm0z6iy'><b>1</b> Posted 2014-11-13 04:56 by kuilin</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"That spell of cursed fire.

"And I once heard about an adult casting Obliviate while she was almost completely drained, so it must not take too much magic to cast. It's not even considered Unforgiveable, though I can't imagine why not. If I could've made Mr. Hagrid remember a different set of orders -" "It is not that straightforward," said the Defense Professor. "You are not powerful enough to use the False Memory Charm, and even a simple Obliviation will stretch the edge of your current stamina. It is a dangerous art, illegal to use without Ministry authorization, and I would caution you not to use it under circumstances where it would be inconvenient to accidentally erase ten years of someone's life. I wish I could promise you that I would obtain one of those highly guarded tomes from the Department of Mysteries, and pass it to you beneath a disguised cover. But what I must actually tell you is that you will find the standard introductory text in the north-northwest stacks of the main Hogwarts library, filed under M." "Seriously," the boy said flatly. "Indeed." "Thank you for your guidance, Professor." "Your creativity has become a great deal more practical, Mr. Potter, since I have known you." "Thank you for the compliment." The boy did not look up from where he was again gazing down at the wand held between his hands. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2qjti1/things_that_seem_obvious_to_you_now_after/cn7fjd6'><b>3</b> Posted 2014-12-28 19:27 by LogicDragon</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"I would like to go back to thinking now.

His face had a dead, emotionless look to it; she would have said that it reminded her of Severus,<sup>[1]</sup></a> though Severus had never looked quite like that. Even as the door clicked shut again, Minerva had thrown up a wordless Quieting barrier. The words spilled forth from her rapidly: "How did it go - you were in there for a while - is Harry talking now?" Professor Quirrell paced swiftly across the room to the far wall near the entrance, looked back at her. The emotionlessness slid off his face, as though he were taking off a mask, leaving behind someone very grim. "I spoke to Mr. Potter as he expected me to speak, and avoided saying things that would annoy him. I do not think it consoled him. I do not think I have the knack." "Thank you - it is good that he spoke at all -" She hesitated. "What did Mr. Potter say?" "I am afraid that I promised him not to speak of it. And now... I think that I must visit the Hogwarts library." "The library?â¯" "Yes," Professor Quirrell said. An uncharacteristic tension had come into his voice. "I intend to strengthen the security upon the Restricted Section with certain precautions of my own devising. The current wards are a joke. And Mr. Potter must be kept out of the Restricted Section at all costs." She stared at the Defense Professor, her heart suddenly in her throat.
