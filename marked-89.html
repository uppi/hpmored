  Cool blue fires clung to the floor in small masses, surrounding a blazing pool that seemed to burn with a deadlier, hotter blue. In one narrow circle the marble tiles were scorched and shattered by <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hn3wr/chapter_93_prediction_thread_spoilers_upto/cavz1tt'><b>38</b> Posted 2013-07-04 23:59 by snowywish</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">some explosive spell that only the most prodigious of first-year witches could have cast,<sup>[1]</sup></a> with the last of her strength. On the terrace, still moving beneath the open sunlight, stood a great lumpy creature of dull granite-grey. Body like a boulder with small bald head perched on top like a stone, short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. One hand held a tremendous stone club as long and as wide as an adult human, and the other hand held The Weasley twins screamed. Harry's Patronus shattered. The troll snorted and spun around to face them, dropping into the red pool that had spread out beneath its feet, raising its club high. Then a Weasley cried an incantation and the club was torn from the troll's hand, smashed into its face so hard it drove the troll back for one of its steps, a blow that might have killed a Muggle. The troll gave a bellow of anger, its nose squashed and blood-spattered, and then the nose straightened once more, regenerated. The troll grabbed with both hands for the club, which shot away through the air but only barely dodged the grab. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hjr1c/spoilers_190_harrys_patronus_and_timeturning/cavbdzm'><b>1</b> Posted 2013-07-03 23:07 by flupo42</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">"Lead it away, keep it off me," said a voice. The levitated club moved backwards from the troll, from the terrace onto the wide-open<sup>[1]</sup></a> floor beneath the ceiling; and the troll made a great prodigious leap that almost brought the club into its hands. Then the troll made another great leap as the club moved to one side; and the broomstick moved forwards and Harry jumped off and ran towards where Hermione Granger was lying in a pool of her own blood with her legs eaten away to the upper thighs. Harry's hands tore open the healer's kit from his pouch, grabbed one of the self-tightening tourniquets, wrapped them around one ragged tooth-marked stump, his hands briefly slipping in the blood, they didn't tremble, there wasn't any allowance for his hands to tremble. As the tourniquet formed a complete loop it tightened hard and more blood came out, but then the bleeding stopped on that thigh-stump, and Harry turned to the other. Part of his mind was screaming, screaming, screaming and even the part of him picking up the other self-tightening tourniquet heard it, but that also wasn't allowed. The two Weasley twins were shouting spells, one after another in rapid-fire casting that would have had Harry unconscious in sixty seconds, sometimes the twins shouted two spells simultaneously in perfect coordination, but most of the spells were disrupting in harmless showers of sparks against the troll's skin. As the other tourniquet tightened itself in another pulse of blood, Harry looked up at a "Diffindo!" / "Reducto!â¯" that made the troll's vulnerable eyes explode in twin showers of vitreous humor, but the troll only bellowed once more, its eyes already reforming. "Fire and acid!â¯" Harry shouted. "Use fire or acid!â¯" "Fuego!" / "Incendio!" Harry heard, but he wasn't looking, he was reaching for the syringe of glowing orange liquid that was the oxygenating potion, pushing it into Hermione's neck at what Harry hoped was the carotid artery, to keep her brain alive even if her lungs or heart stopped, so long as her brain stayed intact everything else could be fixed, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, it had to be possible for magic to fix it, and Harry pushed the plunger of the syringe all the way down, creating a faint glow beneath the pale skin of her neck. Harry then pushed down on her chest, where her heart should be, hard compressions that he hoped was moving the oxygenated blood around to where it could reach her brain, even if her heart might have stopped beating, he hadn't actually thought to check her pulse. Then Harry stared at the other things in his medical kit, his mind going blank as he tried to figure out what else of what was there, if anything, he could use. The screaming in that distant corner of his mind was getting louder, much louder, now that his hands had stopped their frantic motions. He was suddenly aware of the liquid sensation where blood had soaked through his robes <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hc6x6/spoiler_discussion_thread_for_ch_8889/casxzy8'><b>21</b> Posted 2013-06-30 07:19 by RUGDelverOP</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xibdr/spoilers_ch_113_clarifying_mechanics/cp0fy6s'><b>6</b> Posted 2015-03-01 04:56 by cretan_bull</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xiaw9/spoilers_ch_113_assets_and_nonassets_thread/cp0fup5'><b>6</b> Posted 2015-03-01 04:52 by cherryCakesExpress</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2xibdr/spoilers_ch_113_clarifying_mechanics/cp0g9gd'><b>2</b> Posted 2015-03-01 05:08 by cherryCakesExpress</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">and the knees of his pants. From behind Harry came the sound of another bellow from the troll, and he heard one of the Weasley twins shout "Deligitor prodeas!"<sup>[4]</sup></a> and then, "HELP! Do something!" Harry twisted his head back to look, and saw that one of the Weasley twins was somehow now wearing the Sorting Hat on his head, facing off against the troll which held the huge stone club in both its hands, looking somewhat scorched now and with one or two smoking scars across its arms, but still intact. And then the voice of the Hat bellowed in a voice so loud it seemed to shake the walls, "GRYFFINDOR!" A pulse of power burned the air, magic feeling almost tangible even to Harry's young senses, the troll jumped back a pace with a snort of surprise. Fred or George, with a strange look on his face, swept the Hat off his head with a motion smooth as a magician's trick, and reached in with one hand and drew forth a hilt whose pommel was a glowing ruby, followed by a wide crossguard of gleaming white metal, and a blade as long as a tall child. As the sword was revealed the air seemed to fill with a silent scream of fury. <a class="popoverData" href="javascript:void(0);"data-content="<a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hcz9e/discussion_of_the_last_sentences_of_ch_89/cat6pxj'><b>15</b> Posted 2013-06-30 20:22 by apoteo</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hcz9e/discussion_of_the_last_sentences_of_ch_89/cat6pxj'><b>15</b> Posted 2013-06-30 20:22 by apoteo</a><br><a href='http://reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1hi9bf/spoilers_ch_89_sorting_hat/caun2ry'><b>6</b> Posted 2013-07-02 23:33 by chrisfarms</a>" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-trigger="click">Upon the blade was written in golden script, nihil supernum.<sup>[3]</sup></a> Then the Weasley twin raised the sword aloft as though the huge blade weighed nothing, and screamed and charged. Harry's lips opened to say something, some long sentence like, No, stop, you have no idea how to use a sword but not even a single syllable left his lips before the sword sliced off the troll's right arm through the elbow, cutting through skin and flesh and bone like jelly; just as the already-swinging arc of the stone club smashed into the charging Weasley twin and sent him flying through the air above the marble floor, over the gap out of which they'd risen on the broomstick, until that Weasley hit the wall on the opposite side and then collapsed into an unmoving heap. The bright sword vanished down into the opening in the floor, clattering distantly as it dropped. "Fred!â¯" screamed George Weasley, and then "VENTUS!" An invisible blow caught the troll and hurled it sideways through the air. "VENTUS!â¯" The troll was hit again, blown to the edge of the floor and the gap leading downwards. "VENTUS!" But the troll had reached down and grabbed at the floor, its remaining hand crunching through marble to gain a firm hold.
